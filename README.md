## Key Derivation and Encryption Functions

The following Python code demonstrates how to securely encrypt and decrypt files using AES-256 encryption and a passphrase-derived key. It utilizes the PyCryptodome library for cryptographic operations.

### Python Code

```python
from Crypto.Cipher import AES  # Import AES encryption from PyCryptodome
from Crypto.Protocol.KDF import PBKDF2  # Import PBKDF2 key derivation function
from Crypto.Random import get_random_bytes  # Import random byte generator
import os  # Import OS library for file operations

def derive_key(passphrase, salt, iterations=100000):
    return PBKDF2(passphrase, salt, dkLen=32, count=iterations)  # Derive a key of length 32 bytes

def encrypt_file(file_path, passphrase):

    salt = get_random_bytes(16)  # Generate a random salt
    key = get_random_bytes(32)  # Generate a random file encryption key
    cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_GCM)  # Initialize AES cipher in GCM mode
    
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:
        plaintext = f.read()  # Read the file content
    
    ciphertext, tag = cipher.encrypt_and_digest(plaintext)  # Encrypt and generate authentication tag
    
    # Write the encrypted file content along with salt, nonce, and tag
    with open(file_path + '.enc', 'wb') as f:
        f.write(salt + cipher.nonce + tag + ciphertext)
    
    # Encrypt the file encryption key using the passphrase-derived key
    protected_key = AES.new(derive_key(passphrase, salt), AES.MODE_GCM).encrypt(key)
    
    # Store the encrypted file encryption key
    with open('key.enc', 'wb') as f:
        f.write(salt + protected_key)

def decrypt_file(file_path, passphrase):

    # Read the encrypted key and salt
    with open('key.enc', 'rb') as f:
        salt = f.read(16)  # Read the salt
        protected_key = f.read()  # Read the encrypted file encryption key
    
    # Derive the file encryption key from the passphrase
    key = AES.new(derive_key(passphrase, salt), AES.MODE_GCM).decrypt(protected_key)
    
    # Read the encrypted file content, nonce, and tag
    with open(file_path + '.enc', 'rb') as f:
        salt = f.read(16)  # Read the salt (not needed here but included for completeness)
        nonce = f.read(16)  # Read the nonce used during encryption
        tag = f.read(16)  # Read the authentication tag
        ciphertext = f.read()  # Read the ciphertext
    
    # Decrypt the file content using the derived key
    cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_GCM, nonce=nonce)
    plaintext = cipher.decrypt_and_verify(ciphertext, tag)
    
    # Write the decrypted content back to the original file
    with open(file_path, 'wb') as f:
        f.write(plaintext)

```

## 2. Application Workflow

- **Encrypt File**: 
  ```python
  
  encrypt_file('path/to/file', 'user_passphrase')

- **Encrypt File**: 
  ```python

  decrypt_file('path/to/file', 'user_passphrase')
  ```
## 3. High-level Algorithm

**Encrypt File:**
1. Generate a random file encryption key.
2. Encrypt the file with AES-256.
3. Derive a key from the passphrase using KDF.
4. Encrypt the file encryption key with the derived key.
5. Store the encrypted file encryption key.

**Decrypt File:**
1. Derive a key from the passphrase using KDF.
2. Decrypt the file encryption key with the derived key.
3. Decrypt the file with the decrypted file encryption key.

## 4. Justification for Various Crypto Algorithms Used

- **AES-256**: Provides strong encryption suitable for sensitive data.
- **PBKDF2**: Secure KDF that mitigates brute-force attacks on passphrases.

## 5. Type of Open Source and System Routines Used

- **PyCryptodome**: Open-source cryptographic library for Python.
- **os**: Standard Python library for file operations.

## 6. Test Plan for Testing Various Simple and Corner Cases

- **Basic Functionality**: Encrypt and decrypt small text files.
- **Edge Cases**: Encrypt and decrypt large files and directories.
- **Invalid Passphrase**: Test decryption with incorrect passphrases.
- **File Integrity**: Ensure the decrypted file matches the original.
